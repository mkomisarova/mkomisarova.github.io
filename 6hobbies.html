  <h2>All things I like doing in random order (not complete ofc)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Everything math</b> - this is just my life's thing. I loved everything I ever did that was related to math, whether it's learning something new
    or creating problems, or grading papers, or writing grading criteria, or entering olympiad results into excel, or putting stamps on freshly written olympiad papers,
    or teaching a class, or just talking to math community people, or watching math videos, or reading a math book,
    or solving math problems, or taking part in any math competition or olympiad in team or alone.</li>
    <li><b>Traveling</b> - so far I have been only to Europe and mostly famous places, next dream destination is Japan for sure, and China as well</li>
    <li><b>Sudoku</b> - all kinds of, but I especially love speedrunning the easy ones</li>
    <li><b>Origami</b> - especially making boxes</li>
    <li><b>Board games</b> - new faves are Minecraft board game we randomly found in Germany and Wavelength</li>
    <li><b>Reading</b> - detectives and psychology, usually read in English or Russian, and love writing reviews on Goodreads afterwards</li>
    <li><b>Learning languages</b> - currently taking classes of German and Italian, and I am soooo obsessed with learning new things about the words and 
      why do they mean what they mean and how they were created, and I just love yapping about everything in general,
     and next probably will be Polish, and am somewhat a beginner in Ukrainian, Spanish and Korean</li>
    <li><b>Diamond painting</b> - recently became obsessed with it, and I like both square diamonds and circle diamonds, and I actually don't care about what 
    I am diamond painting, because the activity itself is just so relaxing, I recently bedazzled a random painting of a unicorn that my sister was 
    gifted and didn't want to finish</li>
    <li><b>Painting by numbers</b> - sooo fun, and I love that results are always so good looking. A bit hard to do many hours without stopping because the paint
    needs to dry, but it's a great activity anyways.</li>
    <li><b>Junk journaling</b> - I have always collected many sentimental useless things, and this is an amazing way to do something pretty with them
    instead of just have them in a box taking up space. It's very fun to do, it looks cool at the end and all the memories are saved.</li>
    <li><b>Taking walks</b> - I love walking everywhere in general absolutely no matter the weather, I think it's much better than standing and waiting for a bus
    because you move and also get to notice different little things around you, and I like just going for walks randomly because I think our bodies
    just need movement, sunlight and fresh air in general, and it helps with any midday sleepiness and slumps.</li>
    <li><b>Writing (and speaking)</b> - I think I could yap about almost anything forever, I just have so many thoughts about everything and I am always so excited to share
    everything with everyone, and it's a great way to declutter your head as well.</li>
    <li><b>Yoga and gym</b> - helps soooo much with everything, I immediately feel so much better afterwards physically and mentally, and it's also fun and always
    feels so cool and productive</li>
    <li><b>Watching figure skating competitions</b> - I am a huge fan of ladies figure skating, and I am so excited for the upcoming winter 2026 olympics,
    and especially the fact that there is no favourite to win. I also love watching the Russian Jumps competition, and rewatching old programs
    of Trusova and Valieva. Also very excited to see what Malinin does.</li>
    <li><b>Going to concerts</b> - I love seeing artists live, I think many artists actually sound much better live with the band, and it's always such a fun adventure
    as well, and I love taking videos to rewatch later, and it's also quite a breathtaking experience because what do you mean this super famous person
    I listen to everyday everywhere is standing in a few meters in front of me???</li>
    <li><b>Listening to music</b> - I actually love listening to all same music again and again, but I change it overtime, and the more songs I know, the more fun it becomes.
    I try to find and explore new music, and I am not sure about which style I like more, but I do love energetic music, like upbeat songs, and I enjoy
    very boom-like melodies, so some rock here and there, but of course I am a huge pop lover as well</li>
    <li><b>Getting fun little drinks</b> - I am a huge enjoyer of a random sweet drink here and there, I love hot chocolates, matchas, juices, lemonades, and
    I love trying out new flavours of everything, like yes I will gladly drink your new Forest Berry hot chocolate or your new Apple Cherry matcha</li>
    <li><b>Recording and editing videos</b> - mostly a huge fan of filming different hauls, at some point I was filming all my grocery hauls every week for like
    half a year. And I like rewatching my videos afterwards, even if they are 40 minutes long.</li>
    <li><b>Random quizzes/games like Jetpunk or Linkedin/NYT games</b> - I actually did Wordle everyday for many years, and I love competing in mini sudoku
    against all my linkedin connections (not to brag, but I usually place first), and just random games such as naming all 50 us states in 4 minutes 
    (I can do that and I practice probably once a year to make sure I still can) or naming all Taylor Swift songs (I can't name all yet, but I am coming closer
    everytime, I do 100+)</li>
    <li><b>Trying out new things</b> - really heavy on this one, I'm just down to do whatever, like going to a painting or pottery class, or on a sup board,
    or going to a trampoline park, or to a new museum, or seeing a new film in cinema, or even just teaching a lecture to a huge audience, like 
    I looove trying out stuff and just doing most of everything in general, especially when I have company.</li>
  </ul>
