      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>Short and formal version</h4>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about mathematics and problem solving, 
        with years of experience in olympiads and competitive environments. 
        I enjoy diving into new ideas and learning fast, 
        and I’m currently open to math-related opportunities where I can contribute and grow. </p>
      <h4>Long and informal version</h4>
        <p>
          I was born in Jelgava and raised in Riga, Latvia. I attended Riga State gymnasium No.1 2016-2022. 
          I have been participating in olympiads from the first grades, mainly focusing on mathematics,
          but also enjoying linguistics, physics, chemistry, biology, German and other.<br>
          In 2022 I moved to France and started my Bachelor at Ecole Polytechnique, double majoring in Mathematics and Computer
          Science. I have presented my Bachelor Thesis and graduated in June 2025. <br>
          Now, I moved back to Latvia to pursue a Master's degree in Mathematics and Data Science at the University of Latvia,
          starting September 2025, which I am extremely excited about. <br>
          I speak Russian, Latvian, English fluently and French, German not so fluently. 
          I plan to learn either Spanish or Italian in the nearest future. <br>
          I love traveling and discovering new places, enjoy sudoku a lot, and do a lot of other stuff as well - 
          knitting, painting, reading etc.
